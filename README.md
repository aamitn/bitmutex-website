## ⚙️Setup Instructions

  

### 1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**

  

```sh
git  clone  https://github.com/aamitn/bitmutex-website.git
cd  bitmutex-website
```

### 2️⃣ **Install Dependencies and Setup Env File**

  
```sh
yarn setup
```
This will run yarn install  and also copies .env.example to .env on both `client` and `server` directories. After this step `setup your .env` vars accordingly on the auto-generated file.  Create your databases as required. Schema will be auto-generated by Strapi.
- Set `DATABASE_CLIENT=postgres/mysql/sqlite`
- Go to `/server/config/database.ts` and provide DB Credentials there


### 3️⃣ **Run Strapi and Next initially to create strapi**
  ```
 yarn dev
  ```
- After running this strapi should start, go to `http://localhost:1337` and create admin user
- Ctrl-C to stop both strapi and next


### 4️⃣ **Import/Seed DB**
You may run this on the project root,
  ```
 yarn seed
  ```
  or you may run this in `server` directory by doing `cd server`
  ```sh
 yarn strapi import -f ../seed-data.tar.gz --force
  ```
 After running this strapi should strart, go to `http://localhost:1337` and create admin user


### 5️⃣  **Finally Start the application for development **
  ```sh
yarn dev
  ```
  This will start both strapi and nextjs  in development mode (next will have `live refresh` and `watch` enabled)
 
### 6️⃣  **Build for Production**
- Change your .env vars accordingly for production use case
- Go to server directory with `cd server`
- Run Strapi using `yarn develop` then keep the terminal open and open a new terminal , alternatively for UNIX like systems one could run `yarn develop&`
- In the `new terminal` go to project root and navigate to `client` using `cd client`
- Then run the command `yarn build`, this will create NextJs prod build
- Now you may choose to start nextjs using `yarn start` or you may close all the existing terminals and go to project root and run `yarn start` which will start strapi and nextjs both attached to std console terminal.
> To run in cloud VPS/Hosting, use `pm2` , just close any other running instances
  -- Navigate to project root and run `pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs`
  -- Run `pm2 list` to check status and go to [`http://localhost:1337] and [http://localhost:3001]`
  -- If all started successfully, then autostart the app on machine restart using `pm2 save` and `pm2 startup`
  commands.
  -- Use `/server/src/admin/vite.config.ts` to control admin dashboard domain access

## ⚙️Cloud Native Setup Instructions


```sh
docker-compose  up  --build
```

  

This will start:

  

- PostgreSQL at `localhost:5432`

- Strapi CMS at `http://localhost:1337`

- Next.js Frontend at `http://localhost:3000`

  

### 4️⃣ **Manual Data Import (Strapi Limitation)**

  

⚠️ **Strapi does NOT support data import in Docker builds** ([GitHub Issue-17809](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues/17809))

  

**To manually import seed data try:**

  

```sh
docker  exec  -it  bitmutex-strapi  bash
yarn  strapi  import  -f  /seed-data.tar.gz  --force
```

## 🔑 Default Admin Credentials

  

> These credentials are created automatically when `AUTO_CREATE_ADMIN=true` in `docker-compose.yml` or `.env` inside `server` directory.

-  **Email**: `admin@bitmutex.com`
-  **Password**: `strapiadmin`   ()
